# Welcome to MATH0058

In this module you will take your first steps into numerical algorithms
and their efficient implementation.

We will focus on basic algorithms from numerical linear algebra, including
LU Decomposition, QR Decomposition, SVD and eigenvalues. These are the key
foundations for most advanced numerical techniques, including from data science,
numerical solution of PDEs, etc.

At the end of the module we will also take a sidestep into basic interpolation.
There are some wonderful connections to numerical linear algebra, and interpolation
is (next to matrix methods) another key ingredient for more advanced numerical methods.
